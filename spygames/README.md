### Project Overview

 This project was based on, to find secret message  sent by the person using the concepts of Python . 


### Learnings from the project

 I have learnt to handle the files in python properly, use of split() and join() functions of lists, function building block, comprehension and various other python fundamentals.


### Approach taken to solve the problem

 First of all I have collect all data  and store it in different files,according to sequence .Then open each file one by one and analyze the text quoted in it and accordingly created a function  block for them to trace out the secret message hidden in the text and in the end I got the secret mesage.


### Challenges faced

 The main challenge was to understand the steps that each function would need to display the secret message in the proper sequence.And other was to build A function for each FIle path.
